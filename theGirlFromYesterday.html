The film is about school boys and girls, and their stories of love and compassion. <br>
It is based on the novel from the same name by Nguyen Nhat Anh, a best-selling author in Ho Chi Minh City. The book, published in 1990, has sold more than 200,000 copies. It has been used to teach Vietnamese at Moscow State University since 2012. <br>
The producers are hoping the film will be entertaining enough to lure away young audiences, particularly high school students, from Korean and American movies that dominate the local cinema. They have spent more than a year shooting the film, using high-tech equipment. <br>
In addition, another movie based on the novel by author Nguyen Nhat Anh, ‘I See Yellow Flowers On The Green Grass’, from director Victor Vu will be screened in Japan on August 19 with a view to bring Vietnamese culture closer to Japanese people.<br>
Based on the novel from the best-selling author Nguyen Nhat Anh, the film is set in the mid-1980s in a small village, telling the story of two young brothers who share everything, but compete for the affection of the same girl.<br>
The film was Vietnam’s only representative at the TIFF Kids International Film Festival, which is part of the prestigious Toronto International Film Festival.<br>
In addition, this cinematic feature also attained the best film award at the second Silk Road International Film Festival and the Golden Kite at the Vietnam Film Festival 2015.<br>
Hong Kong and Amsterdam-based Fortissimo Films, which handled international sales for the film, introduced the film at the 68th annual Cannes Film Festival. The film was also screened at the American Film Market in Los Angeles in November 2015.<br>
